# RSSReader â€” An RSS reader for iOS8 with Objective C

RSSReader is a simple RSS reader (for BBC News) based on the MWFeedParser (fixed to handle media thumbnail images) in Objective-C and iOS8 including a way to handle the new UISearchControler. It is a very simple and clean implementation that reads the basic information from the RSS feed with search capabilities.

#### Feed Information
- Thumbnail
- Title
- Date
- Summary

The full licence can be found at the end of this document.


## Demo / Example App

There is an example iPhone application within the project which demonstrates how to use a RSS parser to display the News and Search for a given feed, list all of the feed items, and display an item in more detail when tapped.



## Remaining features

- Serialize items feed to CoreData for offline use.
- Show a detailed View based on all feed properties.

Feel free to get in touch and suggest/vote for other features.
